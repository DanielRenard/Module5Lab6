## Calculator Libraries
### Part 1 : 
Expand your application to use a Calculator library that takes care of the
calculations and integrate it in your code.

### Part 2 : 
Change the library so that you can generate a random number to be used as the
ID, instead of the time. This way it will be almost impossible to have two of the same
objects with the same ID.

### Part 3 : 
Create a generic library for logging - pass a message to be logged, this will contain
at least the ID of the caller, and the result. Log to the console every call made.
